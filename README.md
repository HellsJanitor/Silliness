# Silliness
 adds craftable candy that enables/disables silly sounds and celebration

 >[!TIP]
>The download .zip file contains a folder called `\Mods`. You can either:
>1. Copy this folder into your game directory, usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die`
>2. Copy the folder into `%AppData%\Roaming\7DaysToDie`

### 4 Craftable items
These items cost zero resources, and do the following:
1. Enable Silly Sounds, with infinite duration.
2. Disable Silly Sounds.
3. Enable Celebration, with infinite duration.
4. Disable Celebration.

>[!NOTE]
>Celebration is configured to only work on zombies, not any animals.
>This is so resources can be harvested from the animals when they're killed,
>and they don't "poof" out of existence.
